Sunny automatically clears CloudFlare cache. And, protect your WordPress site at DNS level.

* Automatically clears corresponding CloudFlare caches whenever a post/page/media attachment is updated, commented or trashed.
* Purge your entire CloudFlare cache manually
* Purge your a URL cache manually

= How does Sunny different from CloudFlare's offical plugin? =

At the time of writting, CloudFlare's [offical plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cloudflare/) doesn't purge anything for WordPress. It provides the real IP of your visitors and notify CloudFlare when you marking an IP as SPAM. However, it does not include a way to clear the cache or make adjustments to how it works. Here comes Sunny! Sunny focus on cache purging.

= Planned features =

* Blacklist an IP when WP Better Secuity lockdown it

= Things you need to know =

* You need a CloudFlare account.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this plugin written by CloudFlare, Inc.? =

No.
Sunny is written by [Tang Rufus](http://tangrufus.com)

= Can I install both Sunny and CloudFlare's offical plugin at the same time? =

Yes.

= When should I install Sunny and CloudFlare's offical plugin at the same time? =

Install Sunny if you want to purge CloudFlare's cache automatically.
Install the offical plugin if you can't see the real IP from visitors.

= When does Sunny purge my cache? =

Every time a *published* post is updated or commented.
Or, every time post status change from/to `published`

= What pages does it purge when a post is updated? =

The post itself, homepage and its catories, tags and taxonomies archive.
Use the URL purger on `Tools` tab to check what will be cleared for a particular URL.
You can disable this behavior via the `General` tab.

1. Login [CloudFlare](http://cloudflare.com).
2. Release you IP on the threat control dashborad.

= Dose it support mulitsite? =

Confirmed that it doesn't work network wide. While this version of `Sunny` does not intended to support mulitsite, you might want to try activating `Sunny` on a per site basis (WPMU DEV has a step-by-step [tutorial](http://premium.wpmudev.org/manuals/wpmu-manual-2/activating-and-deactivating-plugins-on-a-per-site-basis/)). Please report your findings.

Moreover, I am planning to write a mulitsite version. [Drop me a note](http://tangrufus.com/hire-rufus/) if you want early asscess.
