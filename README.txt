= How does Sunny different from CloudFlare's offical plugin? =

At the time of writting, CloudFlare's [offical plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cloudflare/) doesn't purge anything for WordPress. It provides the real IP of your visitors and notify CloudFlare when you marking an IP as SPAM. However, it does not include a way to clear the cache or make adjustments to how it works. Here comes Sunny! Sunny focus on cache purging.

= Things you need to know =

* You need a CloudFlare account.
* This plugin was not built by CloudFlare.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Check out this [step-by-step tutorial](https://wphuman.com/make-cloudflare-supercharge-wordpress-sites/).

= Is this plugin written by CloudFlare, Inc.? =

No.
Sunny is written by [Tang Rufus](http://tangrufus.com)

= Can I install both Sunny and CloudFlare's offical plugin at the same time? =

Yes.

= When should I install Sunny and CloudFlare's offical plugin at the same time? =

Install Sunny if you want to purge CloudFlare's cache automatically.
Install the offical plugin if you can't see the real IP from visitors.

= When does Sunny purge my cache? =

Every time a *published* post is updated or commented.
Or, every time post status change from/to `published`

= What pages does it purge when a post is updated? =

The post itself, homepage and its catories, tags and taxonomies archive.
Use the URL purger on `Tools` tab to check what will be cleared for a particular URL.
You can disable this behavior via the `General` tab.

= What if Sunny blacklisted my IP? =

1. Login [CloudFlare](http://cloudflare.com).
2. Release you IP on the threat control dashborad.

= Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_FUNCTION in ... =
If you come across this error, make sure that you have PHP 5.3 or later installed.

= Dose it support mulitsite? =

Confirmed that it doesn't work network wide. While this version of `Sunny` does not intended to support mulitsite, you might want to try activating `Sunny` on a per site basis (WPMU DEV has a step-by-step [tutorial](http://premium.wpmudev.org/manuals/wpmu-manual-2/activating-and-deactivating-plugins-on-a-per-site-basis/)). Please report your findings.

Moreover, I am planning to write a mulitsite version. [Drop me a note](https://wphuman.com/contact/) if you want early asscess.
